  title={EVAR: Edge Visual Autoregressive Models via Principled Pruning},
  author={Zefang Wang and Yanyu Li and Mingluo Su and Simin Xu and Guanzhong Tian and Huan Wang},
  booktitle={arxiv},
  year={2026},
  selected={true},
  abstract={We propose a principled OBS-based structured pruning method for visual autoregressive models. Our approach introduces a progressive scale-aware distillation method to address gradient imbalance during next-scale autoregressive fine-tuning. The method achieves 1.8× speedup with only 10% quality loss on single-image generation scenarios on edge devices.},

  author={Junhan Zhu and Hesong Wang and Mingluo Su and Zefang Wang and Huan Wang},
  booktitle={arxiv},
  year={2026},
  selected={true},
  abstract={We propose an OBS-based training-free multi-granularity pruning method adapted for diffusion models. Our approach introduces a timestep-aware Hessian construction with logarithmically decreasing weights to mitigate error accumulation and optimize group pruning efficiency. The method achieves accelerated inference while minimizing visual quality degradation.},

  author={Yihao Chen and Zefang Wang},
  journal={IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)},
  year={2024},
  selected={true},
  abstract={We use a fusion function combining entropy and rank to obtain the information concentration of each layer, which serves as the pruning rate. We propose an explainable Shapley value-based contribution evaluation method as the intra-layer pruning criterion. The method achieves good results in image classification and object detection, demonstrating its effectiveness.},
