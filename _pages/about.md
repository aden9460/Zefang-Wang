Hi, there! I am **Zefang Wang** (王泽芳). Currently, I am a visiting student at the [ENCODE Lab](https://encode-lab-ai.github.io/), Westlake University, advised by [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/). I am also a Master's student at Zhejiang University, advised by [Dr. Guanzhong Tian](https://gylu22.github.io/). Prior to this, I received my B.S. degree from the North University of China.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in **Efficient AI**, with a particular focus on accelerating image generation models via:

- Network pruning
- Knowledge distillation
- Quantization
