Hi there! I am **Zefang Wang** (王泽芳).

I am currently a visiting student at the [ENCODE Lab](https://encode-lab-ai.github.io/), Westlake University, advised by [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/). I am also pursuing my Master's degree in Control Engineering at Zhejiang University, supervised by [Dr. Guanzhong Tian](https://gylu22.github.io/).

Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Rail Transit Signal and Control from North University of China, where I graduated with the top ranking (1%) in my major.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **Efficient AI** and **Model Compression**, with particular emphasis on:

- **Pruning techniques** for visual autoregressive models and diffusion models
- **Network quantization** and binarization
- **Knowledge distillation** for edge deployment
- **Mobile and edge AI** optimization

I am passionate about developing principled and effective compression methods that enable large-scale AI models to run efficiently on resource-constrained devices.
